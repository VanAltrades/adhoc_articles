## Air temperature (C), Wind Speed (m/s), Wind Direction (degrees from; 0=from N, 90=from E, etc.)

Averaging Methods:
Average air temperatures were calculated by arithmetic mean. The average wind speed is the simple scalar average of the raw 5-minute wind speed observations. Note, this technique will produce greater wind speeds than if a true vector average was used, but may be more representative over longer time scales with widely varying wind directions. A "unit-vector" average was used to calculate the average wind direction. In this technique, unity serves as the length of the vector, and the wind direction observations serve as the orientation of the vector. The u and v components are then calculated for each observation. Next, the average u and v components are computed and the average wind direction is derived from "arctan(u/v)".

# Beach Water Quality - Automated Sensors

[chicago water source](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Parks-Recreation/Beach-Water-Quality-Automated-Sensors/qmqz-2xku/about_data)

The Chicago Park District maintains sensors in the water at beaches along Chicago's Lake Michigan lakefront. These sensors generally capture the indicated measurements hourly while the sensors are in operation during the summer. During other seasons and at some other times, information from the sensors may not be available. See https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/k7hf-8y75 for a dataset with land-based weather measurements at selected beaches. The sensor locations are listed at https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/g3ip-u8rb.

Please note that sensor locations change with the Park Districtâ€™s operational needs, primarily related to water quality. For more information on beach operations, please see https://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks-facilities/beaches.
